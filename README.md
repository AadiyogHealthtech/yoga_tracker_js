# Yoga Tracker

Yoga Tracker is a web-based application that uses computer vision to guide users through yoga exercises, track their poses, and count repetitions in real-time. It leverages the MediaPipe Pose library to detect and analyze human poses from a webcam feed, comparing them against predefined keypoints for specific yoga exercises like Anuvittasana (Standing Backbend).

## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Uses MediaPipe Pose to detect and track 33 keypoints on the human body.
- **Exercise Guidance**: Guides users through yoga phases (starting, transition, holding, ending) with visual feedback.
- **Repetition Counting**: Automatically counts reps based on pose completion.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays pose skeletons, rep counts, and exercise status on a canvas overlay.
- **Customizable Exercises**: Supports defining exercises via JSON files with keypoints and segment data.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: For running a local server (optional, but recommended for development).
- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge with WebGL and MediaDevices API support.
- **Webcam**: A working webcam for pose detection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd yoga-tracker
   ```

2. **Set Up Project Files**:
   - Ensure all files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `controller/`, `utils/`, etc.) are in the project directory as provided.
   - Place the `assets/man_keypoints_data_normalized.json` file in an `assets/` folder. This JSON file should contain:
     - `frames`: An array of keypoint data for each frame (e.g., `["x,y,z", ...]`).
     - `segments`: An array defining exercise phases (e.g., `[startFrame, endFrame, "phase_name", [thresholds]]`).

   Example JSON structure:
   ```json
   {
     "frames": [
       ["0.1,0.2,0.3", "0.4,0.5,0.6", ...],
       ...
     ],
     "segments": [
       [0, 1, "starting", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]],
       [94, 200, "transition", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]],
       [200, 365, "holding", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]],
       [2, 3, "ending", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]]
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Serve the Application**:
   - Run a local server to serve the files over HTTP/HTTPS (required for `getUserMedia`):
   If you have python installed in your system 
     ```bash

    

     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8081

     # Or using npm (install serve globally first: npm install -g serve)
     serve -l 8081
     ```
   - Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

   else if you have npm in your system 
```
npx http-server
```


## Usage
1. **Grant Camera Access**:
   - When prompted, allow the browser to access your webcam.

2. **Start the Exercise**:
   - The app initializes with the "Anuvittasana" exercise (configurable in `main.js`).
   - Position yourself in front of the camera to match the starting pose (based on facing direction).

3. **Follow the Phases**:
   - The canvas overlay shows the current exercise, phase, and rep count.
   - Progress through "starting", "transition", "holding", and "ending" phases by matching the predefined poses.
   - Visual feedback includes a green skeleton for detected poses and text instructions.

4. **Complete Reps**:
   - The app counts up to 3 reps (configurable in `exercisePlan`) and resets for the next exercise if defined.

## Configuration
- **Exercise Plan**: Edit `main.js` to modify `exercisePlan`:
  ```javascript
  const exercisePlan = {
      "Anuvittasana": {
          "json_path": "assets/man_keypoints_data_normalized.json",
          "reps": 3
      },
      "AnotherExercise": {
          "json_path": "assets/another_exercise.json",
          "reps": 5
      }
  };
  ```
- **Pose Settings**: Adjust `pose.setOptions` in `main.js` for detection sensitivity:
  ```javascript
  pose.setOptions({
      modelComplexity: 2,          // 0, 1, or 2 (higher = more accurate, slower)
      minDetectionConfidence: 0.5, // 0.0 to 1.0
      minTrackingConfidence: 0.5   // 0.0 to 1.0
  });
  ```

## Troubleshooting
- **"Segments data not available"**:
  - Check if `assets/man_keypoints_data_normalized.json` is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/assets/...`.
  - Verify the JSON structure matches the expected format.
- **"No pose landmarks detected"**:
  - Ensure you’re in the camera’s view and well-lit.
  - Check webcam permissions in your browser.
- **"No valid frame context"**:
  - Confirm `canvasCtx` is correctly initialized in `main.js`.
- **Exercise Not Starting**:
  - Match the starting pose’s facing direction (e.g., "left", "right") as defined in the JSON.
